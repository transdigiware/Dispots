# Dispots
### Dispots is avoid hotspots source disaster point areas are characterized by technology and supported with 3D mapping images strength with high resolution image.

## "The point of Geothermal as sources of disaster" is a apps [the Dispots] (https://transdigiware.github.io/Dispots)
### Hotspot in disaster management such that the determination to significantly to Geothermal System in analyzing its potential as a source of disaster
By using the simple steps we can make applications that are embedded on a mobile device, using the facilities to detect hot spots of the Earth that can lead to disaster in the signal, then the rate of application can be used as a benchmark in the method for distributing the aid in the form of drugs or funds in the area of disaster so as to reduce the impact of bad and other obstacles in disbursing aid in case of disaster in an area.
Avoid hotspots is expected to further facilitate the distribution of relief supplies and other collaborative applications, so that by building a secure supply chain, tough, can be tracked and transparent with blockchain is a great step that soon done because the supply chain is built with blockchain technology that can improve the distribution of supplies and other things, For now Watson Studio we will used too such as the distribution and deployment assistance before and after the great disaster

QRadar Advisor with Watson combines the cognitive capabilities of Watson and the industry leading QRadar Security Analytics Platform to uncover hidden threats and automate insights. The QRadar Advisor with Watson app will enrich security incidents compiled by the QRadar platform with insights from Watson for Cyber Security to investigate and respond to threats at unprecedented speed and scale. By augmenting the analystâ€™s ability to act on threats with confidence, Watson revolutionizes the way security analysts work.

### I/O
Learn about the stages of disaster and multi effects arising in planning of returns back in fixing an area or areas affected by the impact of the disaster, [the collect input and output (I/O)](https://github.com/transdigiware/qiskit-api-py) data are sometimes swept up all of the negative and positive of existing events.
When the disaster comes, all accurate and continuous information management can be used as a reference in the process of planning data collection, research programs for the recovery process and standard help hierarchy in times of disaster, pre-disaster and post-disaster, all of which can include large data also a large process involving computer systems that should have been developed for the advancement of humanity and technology.
